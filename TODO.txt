HOUSEKEEPING

- Indicate Linux build dependencies somewhere (README or CMakeLists.txt)

IDEAS
- Triangular and Hexagonal grids (add to save format)
  Level selection buttons indicate the type of grid (in the shape of the button?)
- Other types of symmetry besides 2-fold: 4-fold on square grid, 2-, 3- or 6-fold on hexagonal grid, 3-fold on triangular grid.
  Each core can have its own symmetry, indicated in the save format with uppercase letters (aa, aA, Aa, AA = types 0, 1, 2, 3, for the same coords).
- Each core indicates the type of symmetry it produces
