SETUP:

Starting from Android SDK 26 the "android" tool does not support the "update project" command. Install version 25 from: http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/platform_tools_r25.2.5-linux.zip
And then: tools/bin/sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-26" "build-tools;26.0.3"

Follow https://wiki.libsdl.org/Android (3.2. SDL wrapper + SDL_image NDK module)
Copy Android.mk from this folder into the <SDL>/build/com.qojat.galaxies/jni/src/Android.mk

Create symlinks for SDL2_ttf and SDL2_mixer
Edit Android.mk in SDL2_mixer and set to "false" all SUPPORT_* flags except SUPPORT_OGG (specially MPG123 which does not seem to build for x86).

GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES (WIP)
Trying to do everything from C (through JNI) is hard...
Using Android SDK install "Android Support Repository" (or Google Repository).
Extract the aar files with jar xf ...aar
Rename classes.jar into whatever.jar and copy into libs folder:
play-services-auth-11.0.4.jar
play-services-auth-base-11.0.4.jar
play-services-base-11.0.4.jar
play-services-basement-11.0.4.jar
play-services-drive-11.0.4.jar
play-services-games-11.0.4.jar
play-services-tasks-11.0.4.jar
support-compat-25.3.1.jar

Or you could use Gradle and Maven and have them download it for you:
- Install Maven
- mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:11.8.0 -DremoteRepositories=https://maven.google.com
