SETUP:

Starting from Android SDK 26 the "android" tool does not support the "update project" command. Install version 25 from: http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/platform_tools_r25.2.5-linux.zip
And then: tools/bin/sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-26" "build-tools;26.0.3"

Follow https://wiki.libsdl.org/Android (3.2. SDL wrapper + SDL_image NDK module)
Copy Android.mk from this folder into the <SDL>/build/com.qojat.galaxies/jni/src/Android.mk

Create symlinks for SDL2_ttf and SDL2_mixer
Edit Android.mk in SDL2_mixer and set to "false" all SUPPORT_* flags we don't need (OGG, FLAC, and specially MPG123 which does not seem to build for x86).
